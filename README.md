The text collection in this repository is a sample of the Athome4 collection,
which was used in the TREC 2016 Total Recall Track [1]. The original dataset
contains 290,000 Jeb Bush emails and 34 topics. 

We provided 9 topics (`athome4.topics.sample`), some sampled documents 
(`athome4_sample.tgz`), and some relevance judgments (`athome4.qrel.sample`) 
for this sampled test collection.
